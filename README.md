Hello, and thank you for visiting my GitHub!

Iâ€™m Sara Fisher, an aspiring data analyst looking to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to a career in data analytics/business intelligence.

I have over six years of experience as a translator, where I helped more than 30 repeat clients in over a dozen different industries (including the automotive, software development, interior design,  international tourism, sports journalism, and skilled immigration sectors) further their business and generate value across national and linguistic borders. I've decided to seek new challenges and opportunities in the field of data analytics, and believe that I can offer great value to potential employers with my attention to detail, time management skills, intellectualy curiosity, and ability to think critically, creatively, and with the target audience in mind.

I'm a voracious learner looking to gain skills and experience at every opportunity. Skills I've acquired include:
- SQL (Postgres, MySQL)
- Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Data visualization (Tableau, PowerBI, Excel)
- Descriptive and inferential statistics
- Machine learning fundamentals (SciKitLearn, popular models in regression, classification, clustering, and association rule learning)

I'm currently learning about:
- Applied linear algebra and calculus
- Feature engineering and selection
- Deep learning libraries (Keras, Tensorflow, PyTorch)
- Big Data (Hadoop, Apache Spark)
